# HTTPS Migration Verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Launch Settings Updated
- **API Project**: Removed HTTP profile, kept only HTTPS on port 7185
- **Web Project**: Removed HTTP profile, kept only HTTPS on port 7029

### 2. Program.cs Configuration
- **API Project**:
  - Set `RequireHttpsMetadata = true` for JWT authentication
  - Updated CORS to only allow HTTPS origins
  - Removed HTTP origins from CORS policy

- **Web Project**:
  - Updated CORS to only allow HTTPS API origin
  - Added secure cookie settings to authentication configuration
  - Removed duplicate HTTPS redirection
  - Fixed duplicate session middleware

### 3. Cookie Security
- All cookies now use `SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always`
- All cookies use `SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax`
- Authentication cookies are properly secured with `HttpOnly = true`

### 4. JWT Configuration
- Updated JWT ValidAudience to `https://localhost:7029`
- Updated JWT ValidIssuer to `https://localhost:7185`

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the applications**:
   ```bash
   # Use the provided startup scripts
   .\start-both-projects.ps1
   # or
   .\start-both-projects.bat
   ```

2. **Verify HTTPS endpoints**:
   - API: https://localhost:7185/swagger
   - Web: https://localhost:7029
   - Both should load without security warnings

3. **Test cookie behavior**:
   - Login to the web application
   - Check browser developer tools → Application → Cookies
   - Verify all cookies have "Secure" flag set
   - Verify cookies are sent only over HTTPS

4. **Test API communication**:
   - Web application should successfully communicate with API
   - No CORS errors should occur
   - JWT tokens should be properly validated

## Security Benefits

- ✅ All traffic encrypted with HTTPS
- ✅ Cookies only sent over secure connections
- ✅ JWT tokens require HTTPS metadata
- ✅ CORS restricted to HTTPS origins only
- ✅ SameSite cookie protection maintained
- ✅ HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Certificate warnings**: Accept the development certificates
2. **CORS errors**: Verify both applications are running on HTTPS
3. **Authentication failures**: Check JWT configuration matches HTTPS URLs
4. **Cookie issues**: Clear browser cookies and try again

The migration is complete and your application now enforces HTTPS throughout, resolving the SameSite cookie security issue.
